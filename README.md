# Support Vector Machine Classifier | CIFAR 10

## Overview
This project involves using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs in image classification tasks and to explore various techniques related to SVM, such as kernel choice and hyperparameter tuning.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **SVM Implementation**: Implementation of the SVM classifier, including hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics to measure the model's performance.

## Results
- The identification of optimal SVC parameters for color and B/W images, enabling the fine-tuning of our classifiers.
- A comparative analysis of F1 scores between color and B/W CIFAR datasets, offering insights into the impact of color information on model performance.

Analysis suggests that color information plays a significant role in the classification accuracy of SVM models on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
