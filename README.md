## Overview
This project involves using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs in image classification tasks and to explore various techniques related to SVM, such as kernel choice and hyperparameter tuning.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **SVM Implementation**: Implementation of the SVM classifier, including hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics to measure the model's performance.

## Results
- **Optimal SVC Parameters Identified**: For both the color and B/W images, the project determines the best SVC parameters, enabling the enhancement of classifier performance.
- **Color vs. B/W CIFAR Dataset Analysis**: A comparative study of F1 scores between the color and B/W CIFAR datasets reveals significant findings. Notably, the models trained on the color dataset consistently demonstrated better F1 scores compared to those trained on the B/W dataset. This outcome underscores the importance of color information in improving the classification accuracy and overall model performance.

This enhanced performance on the color dataset suggests that color features play a crucial role in the effective classification of images.
